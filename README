just record indices of items to remove and remove them at end of loop
picking up duplicate keys
    check the tile with 2 duplicate green keys in json file
    12+4=16, 8+4=12
    can't do splice for every case, in cases traversing changing items, need to remove item
    iterating over array using indices is BAD, need to use iterator
advance to next level
