generate default map model


a MapManager should do the load/save stuff, not MapEditor

how to handle movement for non-Chip entities (should the logic be in the Tile itself?)
    store references to things that need to move (Chip, Enemies)

    there will be a Chip object and multiple Enemy objects for given map

    Chip {
        TileSource
        CurrentLocation
        Inventory
    }

    Enemy {
        TileSource
        CurrentLocation
        PathingRoute
    }

    use MVC; M = Map, V = MapCanvas, C = MapManager
    when needing to move one of them:
        pass (Chip|Enemy, desiredDirection) to MapManager

        MapManager.move:
            get TileStack at given location in map
            find tile containing TileSource(s)
            pop that tile from stack
            look at desiredDirection to determine where to move tile, how to orient, etc.

    have a MapManager to alter tiles:
        move:
            * if is direction based (multiple images for same entity with different versions according to direction)
            * or if just rotate the tile
